# exploreAT-wordmapconnected
The prototype allows for word/text searches. Individual results of words are displayed on a map to show their geographical location and distribution according to the same source. Narrowing results to word categories or according to time are possible. Hovering over individual entries on the map gives information on lemma, location and source and their possible connections.
